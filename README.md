## OrganizaC√ÉO - An app made to the smalls animals shelter :cat:
###
This app was thought to help the smalls animals shelter to control the flux of rescued animals and adopted animals. :dog:
###
This way, volunteers and the shelter managers will know the health status, age, custom care, race and history of each animal that has been in the shelter,
making the day by day a lot easier. :rabbit:
